# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). TinyApp allows users to not only create and share shortened URLs (Great for reducing the character count of particularly long tweets!), but also lets users make an account to store and edit their TinyURLs right in the app. 

## Final Product

Main page, displaying URLs, their shortened counterparts, as well as buttons to edit and delete each item.
